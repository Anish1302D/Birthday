                Dear Anjali,<br><br>
                On this special day, I wish you a wonderful birthday filled with love, happiness, and unforgettable memories! 🎉 Although it hasn’t been long since we met, our bond has grown so much stronger in such a short time.<br><br>
                You always bring smiles and positivity wherever you go, and your ability to understand double-meaning jokes so quickly never fails to make me laugh! 😂 And oh, I can’t forget how much I enjoy listening to your funny and dramatic controversies between Bhushan and Rahul! 😄<br><br>
                May this year bring you closer to your dreams and fill your life with endless joy and success. You deserve all the happiness in the world! 💜<br><br>
                Enjoy your day to the fullest and make beautiful memories! 🥳<br><br>
                Sending lots of love, hugs, and best wishes your way! 💕
